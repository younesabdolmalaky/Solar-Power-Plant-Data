## About Dataset
Solar energy generation is one of fastest growing and most promising renewable energy sources of power generation worldwide. Nowadays, the electrical energy becomes one of the basic needs in our daily life, which makes increasing demand for it.
As a major source of electrical power generation fossil fuels are depleting day by day and also its usage raises serious environmental concerns. These reasons force the development of new energy sources which are renewable and ecologically safe.
There are several applications that use solar power, here is the information on the generation of electricity through PV cells. The solar power generation is the most efficient route for power generation because it takes a minimum number of steps (for producing electricity) than that of other generation methods.
PV solar cells are interconnected to form a PV module to capture the sun rays and convert solar energy into electricity. So when the PV modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current. It is one of the best ways in nowadays which can transfer the solar energy into utilization. Many countries in the world have taken this technique into utilization; however, the estimation of the PV generation is a challenge because the PV system generation is greatly affected by the weather conditions.
As the weather has great influence on the production of PV systems, such as irradiation, temperature, humidity, wind velocity. The goal of this competition is to build the relationship between the weather with the production of PV systems by analyzing history data. Through the model, we are able to use predicted data of weather in the near future to predict the production of PV systems. Once the result deviate much from
prediction, probably there are problems with PV system, and the reason need to be figured out, and then adopt proper measure to fix the PV system and make better decisions. For example, according to the accurate forecast, PV system operators can balance the consumption of power and reserve spared power for emergency.

## catboost 
CatBoost builds upon the theory of decision trees and gradient boosting. The main idea of boosting is to sequentially combine many weak models (a model performing slightly better than random chance) and thus through greedy search create a strong competitive predictive model.
