Solar energy generation is one of fastest growing and most promising renewable energy sources of power generation worldwide. Nowadays, the electrical energy becomes one of the basic needs in our daily life, which makes increasing demand for it.
As a major source of electrical power generation fossil fuels are depleting day by day and also its usage raises serious environmental concerns. These reasons force the development of new energy sources which are renewable and ecologically safe.
There are several applications that use solar power, here is the information on the generation of electricity through PV cells. The solar power generation is the most efficient route for power generation because it takes a minimum number of steps (for producing electricity) than that of other generation methods.
PV solar cells are interconnected to form a PV module to capture the sun rays and convert solar energy into electricity. So when the PV modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current. It is one of the best ways in nowadays which can transfer the solar energy into utilization. Many countries in the world have taken this technique into utilization; however, the estimation of the PV generation is a challenge because the PV system generation is greatly affected by the weather conditions.
As the weather has great influence on the production of PV systems, such as irradiation, temperature, humidity, wind velocity. The goal of this competition is to build the relationship between the weather with the production of PV systems by analyzing history data. Through the model, we are able to use predicted data of weather in the near future to predict the production of PV systems. Once the result deviate much from
prediction, probably there are problems with PV system, and the reason need to be figured out, and then adopt proper measure to fix the PV system and make better decisions. For example, according to the accurate forecast, PV system operators can balance the consumption of power and reserve spared power for emergency.

The goal of this project is to use the CatBoost regression algorithm to analyze the solar power plant data and make predictions about the system production.
#### Import Libraries
The following libraries are imported for the project:
Pandas for reading and manipulating the data
Numpy for numerical operations
Sklearn for evaluation metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error and R2 score)
CatBoost for building and training the regression model
StandardScaler for feature scaling
#### Load Data
The data is loaded from a .csv file into a Pandas DataFrame and the first five rows of the data are displayed.
#### Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps are performed on the data:
Convert the type of the date column from string to datetime
Extract the date and hour information from the datetime column
Create a feature for the season of the year based on the date
Create a feature for the time of day (day or night) based on the hour
Convert categorical variables (season and time of day) into numerical values using one-hot encoding
Drop unnecessary columns (date and datetime)
#### Model Training
The data is split into training and testing sets with 80% for training and 20% for testing. The CatBoost Regressor is then trained on the training data using the mean absolute error as the evaluation metric and 20000 iterations.
####Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on the testing data using the mean absolute error, mean squared error and R2 score.
